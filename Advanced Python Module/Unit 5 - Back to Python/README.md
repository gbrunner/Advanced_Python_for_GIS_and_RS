# Unit 5 Assignment

These lessons serve as a refresher on Python and ArcGIS Notebooks. 
The same lessons also apply to Jupyter Notebooks. 
The ["Hello, Notebook!"](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=5aee4d0f252941e1ae421b78a8ccbe60) lesson is optional. 
You do not need to submit anything for it, 
but it may be helpful in reminding you how to use 
ArcGIS Notebooks and Python. Please complete 
["ArcGIS Notebooks: Terminology, Components, Shortcuts"](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=efe0eff68b024cd8b7226a22dde99e47) and 
["ArcGIS Notebook Runtimes, Environments, and Packages"](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0b3caee2d24f4212a72086936adf31e5), 
including the Summary and Challenge questions at the end. 
Submit a notebook or a link to an ArcGIS Notebook for 
those two exercises.
