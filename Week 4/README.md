## Preparation: 
1. Don't forget to work on Project 1.
2. Read Chapters 6 and 7 of Rubalcava. Chapter 7 can be a bit intimidating. Don't get concerned if you don't understand it. Rather than focus on creating widgets, we will focus on using them. After reading Chapter 7, please look at the following examples:
- [Legend Widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-legend/index.html)
- [Layer List Widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-layerlist-actions/index.html)
- [Search Widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-search-3d/index.html)

## Lecture 1 - Popups and Popup Template
Popups are ususally a uses first interaction with a map.

Let's take a look at how we can add popups to our apps.

### The Easy Way - Add a Popup through ArcGIS Online
Let's get started by mapping NHL Draft Prospects!
[2017 NHL Draft Products](http://slustl.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d071140cea6c44818fc19a583bebf716)

We can find this Feature Layer by searching "NHL Draft" Feature Layers in ArcGIS Online.

Let's open this in a *New Map*.

Let's symbolize the players with a [puck](https://www.hockeyshot.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/b/l/black-puck.jpg)

Let's change the *Basemap*

Next, let's conficure a popup!

After that, let's save the Webmap.

Let's share the Webmap with everyone too.

Let's load the webmap into a JS API App.

Now, let's go to the [Webmap Basic](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/webmap-basic/index.html) example, and switch the basemap ID.

Pretty easy, right?

Let's copy that code into an HTML file and save it before leaving.

### Loading the Popup through Code using Popup Template
Let's open up the Popup teamplate Basic Example and start there:

Let's change the feature service to be: [NHL Prospects](https://services7.arcgis.com/fX3LzGegyrqMlv6s/ArcGIS/rest/services/2017NHLDraftProspects/FeatureServer/0)

Let's change the center map location to be:
```
center:[-90, 38],
zoom: 4
```
Now, let's change the *template* to reflect the feature service.

Easy, right?!

#### Now Let's Recreate the first Map's symbology, too!

Wee need to add a *renderer* and a *symbol*

**Our *Symbol***
```
 var symbol = {
      type: "picture-marker",  // autocasts as new PictureMarkerSymbol()
      url: "https://www.hockeyshot.ca/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/b/l/black-puck.jpg",
      width: "48px",
      height: "48px"
};
```
**Our *renderer***
```
var renderer = {
      type: "simple",  // autocasts as new SimpleRenderer()
      symbol: symbol
    };
```
**Our *Feature Layer***
```
var featureLayer = new FeatureLayer({
        url: "https://services7.arcgis.com/fX3LzGegyrqMlv6s/ArcGIS/rest/services/2017NHLDraftProspects/FeatureServer/0",
        outFields: ["*"],
        renderer: renderer,
        popupTemplate: template
      });
      map.add(featureLayer);
```

## Lecture 2 - Widgets
My focus is not to get you writing your own widgets. That is beyond my intended scope of this class. My emphasis is that I want you to be able to use widgets. To do that, we'll look at specific out of the box widgets that come with the **ArcGIS API for Javascript 4**.

### Home Button Widget
Let's go back to Week 3 and look at the [3D Global Population app](https://gbrunner.github.io/Advanced_Python_for_GIS_and_RS/Week%203/world_pop_3d_w_home.html)

Notice, we used the home button and that was imported via
```
 "esri/widgets/Home",
 ```
 
 The implementation was very straightforward and only required a few lines of code:
 ```
var homeBtn = new Home({
    view: view
});
// Add the home button to the top left corner of the view
view.ui.add(homeBtn, "top-left");
```

Implementing widgets is generally this easy. 
- We import it. 
- We assign it properties. 
- And we put it on the user interface.

### Search Widget
Let's take the global population example we were looking at last week, remove the buttons, and add a search widget.

Let's look at the [Search Widget Example](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-search-3d/index.html)

All we have to do is add:
```
	  var searchWidget = new Search({
        view: view
      });

      // Add the search widget to the top right corner of the view
      view.ui.add(searchWidget, {
        position: "top-right"
      });
```

Easy, right?!

### Legend Widget
Now, let's add a Legend!

Check out the [legend example](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-legend/index.html).

All we should need to do is add:
```
view.when(function() {
// get the first layer in the collection of operational layers in the WebMap
// when the resources in the MapView have loaded.
var featureLayer = scene.layers.getItemAt(0);

var legend = new Legend({
  view: view,
  layerInfos: [{
    layer: featureLayer,
    title: "World Population"
  }]
});

// Add widget to the bottom right corner of the view
view.ui.add(legend, "bottom-right");
```
Again, it's that easy! Now it's time for you to play!

## Classwork\Homework Problems:

1. Create a webapp and popup following from the *popup_from_fl_black_symbol.html* using one of the datasets listed here:
- Using the [STL Neighborhoods Feature Layer](http://slustl.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=70fefcbe59ea421da9169a46b341dfa9)
- Starting with the *popup_from_fl_black_symbol.html*, comment out the *renderer*:
```
/*
var renderer = {
  type: "simple",  // autocasts as new SimpleRenderer()
  symbol: {
    type: "simple-marker",  // autocasts as new SimpleMarkerSymbol()
    size: 6,
    color: "black",
    outline: {  // autocasts as new SimpleLineSymbol()
      width: 0.5,
      color: "white"
    }
  }
};*/
```
- Remove ```renderer: renderer,```
- Change the URL to ```http://services.arcgis.com/Ak4vS4r1vIYUiU3q/arcgis/rest/services/StLNeighborhoods/FeatureServer/0```
- Change the zoom and center to be over St. Louis:
```
center:[-90, 38],
zoom: 4
```
-  Modify the template title to be:
```         
title: "Neighborhood: {NHD_NAME}",
```
- Modify the template ```content``` to be:
```
       [{
          // It is also possible to set the fieldInfos outside of the content
          // directly in the popupTemplate. If no fieldInfos is specifically set
          // in the content, it defaults to whatever may be set within the popupTemplate.
          type: "fields",
          fieldInfos: [{
            fieldName: "POP2000",
            label: "2000 Population: ",
            visible: true,
            format: {
              digitSeparator: true,
              places: 0
            }
          }, {
            fieldName: "POP2010",
            label: "2010 Population: ",
            visible: true,
            format: {
              digitSeparator: true,
              places: 0
            }
          }]
        }]
```
- Change the title: ```<title>Intro to PopupTemplate - 4.8</title>```

2. (**Optional**) Do this with another STL dataset:
- [St. Louis School Districts](http://slustl.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cb8c591911fc4e3090b1371cb0f4ba87)
- [St. Louis Parishes](http://slustl.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ebb8787f96424ea88649e228f2dcfef5)

3. Add the Legend Widget and Layer List Widget to the [3D Boston Planning](http://slustl.maps.arcgis.com/home/webscene/viewer.html?webscene=8046207c1c214b5587230f5e5f8efc77) Exameple that we made last week. Use the file [boston_globe_starting_point.html](https://github.com/gbrunner/Advanced_Python_for_GIS_and_RS/blob/master/Week%204/boston_globe_starting_point.html) as your starting point.
- Let's start with the [Legend Widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-legend/index.html)
- Add ```"esri/widgets/Legend",``` to the ```require``` statement.
- Add ```Legend``` into the ```function(...)``` after ```Camera```
- Add a ```view.when``` function to create the legend:
```
      view.when(function() {
	
          // get the first layer in the collection of operational layers in the WebMap
          // when the resources in the MapView have loaded.
        var featureLayer = scene.layers.getItemAt(1);

        var legend = new Legend({
          view: view,
          layerInfos: [{
            layer: featureLayer,
            title: "Major project buildings"
          }]
        });
```
- Add the legend to the UI within the ```view.when``` function
```view.ui.add(legend, "bottom-right");```
- Next, add the [Layer List Widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-layerlist/index.html)
- Add ```"esri/widgets/LayerList",``` to the require statement after the Lenged.
- Add ```LayerList``` into the ```function(...)``` after the ```Legend```.
- Add the ```layerList``` withing the same ```view.when(function() {``` that you put the **Legend** within.
```
var layerList = new LayerList({
  view: view
});
```
- Add the Layer List to the UI. Do this within the ```view.when``` function:
```view.ui.add(legend, "bottom-right");```




4. (**Optional**) Take a look at the other widget examples on the [Sample Widget Page](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/index.html?search=Widget). Add a two of the following widgets to an existing sample that we have worked on in Week 2, 3, or 4.
- [Scale Bar Widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-scalebar/index.html)
- [Custom Basemap Widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/basemap-custom/index.html)
- [Expand Widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-expand/index.html)
- [Any of the other samples](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/index.html?search=Widget) that use widgets that you want to play with!
