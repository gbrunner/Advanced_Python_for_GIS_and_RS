# Advanced Python for Remote Sensing\GIS

## Course Description
Through this course, students will learn how to publish, 
consume, and analyze web services using Python, 
Javascript, and HTML. They will be introduced to 
more powerful, more advanced Python libraries such as 
Pandas, Numpy, and ArcGIS in addition to learning 
advanced geographic data visualization techniques 
that leverage Python, Javascript, and web APIs. 
They will also learn how to use the Javascript to create their 
first stand-alone web applications. Topics will include using 
GitHub to host web applications, using Javascript and HTML to 
create web applications, and using Python for spatial data 
science. This class builds on what students learned in GIS 
4090\5090 and helps them develop 
knowledge and skills that they will use throughout their careers. 

## Course Objectives
- Students will develop programming skills that are beyond the 
fundamentals of Introduction to Programming for GIS and remote 
sensing learned through GIS 4090\5090.
- Students will learn how to work with geographic web services, 
including, but not limited to automating publishing web services, 
consuming web services, and performing analysis directly on geographic web services.
- Students will learn modern data science methods and tools that can be 
used to augment their research in geography and remote sensing.
- Students will begin implementing it in their own research projects 
such as theses and capstones.

## Materials
Course Materials will be shared using Blackboard. 
Slides, labs, and homework are in the folders that correspond 
to the specific units covered in class.

## Learning Assessment:
- Learning objectives will be assessed through homework assignments and a series of projects, each of which will focus on a different aspect of programming and its applications to GIS and remote sensing. 
- Understanding of web development, Javascript, and HTML will be assessed through a project where students will develop a web application that consumes or uses geographic web services (Project 1).
- Students understanding of working with geographic web services will be assessed by completing a project where they automate the creation and analysis of web services (Project 2)
- Understanding of advanced analytical techniques and data science techniques will be assessed by a project where student will leverage techniques to perform spatial statistics or analysis (Project 3)
- Understanding of how geographic web services, advanced analytical techniques, and web development will be assessed through a student defined Final Project that will be presented to the class.

## Feedback and Assessment
In order to ensure that students are on track to achieve 
the course objectives, students will have weekly coding 
assignments. The coding assignments will be graded and 
returned before the next online lecture, where the 
solutions will be reviewed, and questions will be 
addressed. Feedback on respective assignments will also 
be given to each student through Blackboard. Weekly 
assignment will become the foundation for student projects 
which will serve as the benchmarks for whether students 
understand how to use programming to solve GIS and remote 
sensing problems. There will be 3 projects over the course 
of the semester. Project one will assess whether students 
understand how to build and host web applications that 
contain maps and spatial data. Project two will instruct 
students on writing advanced imagery analysis algorithms 
and data science techniques. Project three will assess 
whether students understand the entire lifecycle of spatial 
data analysis, from data discovery and analysis to data sharing 
via a web application. For projects one and three, discussion 
with classmates and me is encouraged as each student has the 
opportunity to shape his or her own project and goals. The instructor 
will make himself available for virtual office hours weekly on Mondays 
from 4 to 5 PM using Zoom. If you have questions or concerns, donâ€™t hesitate 
to meet with me during office hours, send me an email, or schedule an ad-hoc 
meeting with me outside of our regular meetings or office hours. For week 1 
of class, please post your name, discipline of study, and academic interests 
in the Introductions discussion channel in Blackboard. If you ever need to 
talk, do not hesitate to reach out to me.
