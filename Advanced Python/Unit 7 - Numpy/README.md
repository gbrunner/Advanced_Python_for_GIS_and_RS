# Unit 7 Lecture Jupyter Notebooks and Data
This week we will discuss numpy. 
Last semester we touched on this, 
however, this semester I want you 
to gain a deeper understanding of 
all that you can do with it.

Assignment

# [Unit 7 Assignment](https://arcg.is/1r1fbv)
Please complete [Unit 7 - Numpy Challenge](https://arcg.is/1r1fbv). Do 
not Google the answers until you are 
completely out of ideas. Even if you 
can't figure out the answers, show me 
your thought process. For example, how 
are you creating the array? How do you 
sum an array?
