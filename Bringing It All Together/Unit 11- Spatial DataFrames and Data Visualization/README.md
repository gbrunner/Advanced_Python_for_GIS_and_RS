[ArcGIS API for Python: Getting to Know Pandas and the Spatial Enabled DataFrame](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Lnz-rfWQo)
This presentation will cover modern Pandas best practices by 
using examples as well as how to 
use the new Spatially Enabled DataFrame introduced 
at v1.5 (August 2018) in ArcGIS API for Python. 
It will build from the ground up moving from simple tabular 
data to working with spatial data. It uses Python 3, 
Pandas, ArcPy, and other packages to create a nice 
presentation for everyone to learn foundational 
Pandas/Spatial Enabled DataFrame usage.
 
# [Chapter 4 of Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html)
The lectures and challenge problems this week are about 
data visualization. Please use Chapter 4 of the Python Data 
Science Handbook as a reference this week.


# [Introduction to the Spatially Enabled DataFrame](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/introduction-to-the-spatially-enabled-dataframe/)
The Spatially Enabled DataFrame inserts a custom 
namespace called spatial into the popular Pandas 
DataFrame structure to give it spatial abilities. 
This allows you to use intutive, pandorable operations 
on both the attribute and spatial columns. Thus, the SEDF is 
based on data structures inherently suited to data analysis, 
with natural operations for the filtering and inspecting of 
subsets of values which are fundamental to statistical and 
geographic manipulations.

# [Visualizing Data with the Spatially Enabled DataFrame](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/visualizing-data-with-the-spatially-enabled-dataframe/)
The Spatially Enabled Dataframe has a [plot()](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/apidoc/html/arcgis.features.toc.html?arcgis.features.GeoAccessor.from_featureclass#arcgis.features.GeoAccessor.plot) method that uses 
a syntax and symbology similar to matplotlib for visualizing 
features on a map. With this functionality, you can easily visualize 
aspects of your data both on a map and on a matplotlib chart using 
the same symbology!

# [Spatially Enabled DataFrame - Advanced Topics](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/spatially-enabled-dataframe-advanced-topics/)
The information in this section provides a brief introduction 
to advanced topics with the Spatially Enabled DataFrame structure.

One of the most important tasks for software applications is to 
quickly retrieve and process information. Enterprise systems, 
whether storing GIS information or not, all utilize the concept of 
indexing to allow for quick searching through large data stores to 
locate and select specific information for subsequent processing.

This document will outline how row and column indexing work 
in Spatially Enabled Dataframes and also demonstrate 
building a spatial index on dataframe geometries to 
allow for quick searching, accessing, and processing. 
The document will also demonstrate spatial joins to 
combine dataframes.

# Unit 11 Assignment
In preparation for next week, I would like you to complete the 
following two exercises on Spatial DataFrames. The first 
exercises is ["Load a Spatial DataFrame."](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-python-api/blob/master/labs/load_spatial_data_frame.ipynb) The second exercise is 
["Data Visualization with the Spatially Enabled DataFrame."](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=30f62af60c9b4493bc3fa59d77209b2d) 
Please complete the challenge questions and submit your 
notebooks here.

1. [Load a Spatial DataFrame](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-python-api/blob/master/labs/load_spatial_data_frame.ipynb)
