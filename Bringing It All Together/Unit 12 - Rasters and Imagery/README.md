We are living in a golden era of remote sensing and aerial imagery. 
Significant advancements in satellite launch vehicles, dropping the 
cost per kilogram to space, miniaturization of optical imaging 
pipelines, development of drone-based imaging and increasing 
commercialization of the space industry, has led to the 
proliferation of satellite images and aerial images 
collected with high spatial and temporal resolution. 
With the high abundance of this data comes opportunities 
to find information and derive value out of them.

# Unit 12 Assignment
This week, I would like you to complete two exercises. 
The first exercise, ["Explore Dynamic Imagery of Volcanic Eruption"](https://ago-item-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/0e5792147434448a89a6725a222dbadf/Explore_dynamic_imagery_of_a_volcanic_eruption.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEO3%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDKJHAkiyrxQ7Dz9UgyVBPZNWCyrakWfYObi3nqa3ENyQIgS5Nzgk2me2V%2F4mnHy2qPVI%2FfdBwfn%2FmCfa06GAM%2BK54qtAMIZhAAGgw2MDQ3NTgxMDI2NjUiDMqffvGlpL5OPeiw8CqRA8nCRi1xdOuzFCWGJrPlsH9c97ehsUuS%2Fp2XJHjH8TzQ9V2MX5JrybxkpXk2RYuggs8MWkPw%2FgphlkZYY7mcK2IKKeqf1IkN9yl068jtKpvNCGYjvkM4IXJckH8A0hwEiSTETp2IqBs9GwplNAiUo3v%2B2XL8de6YzLLVwTJrX11wODRrOV9eVlegetekQxeOJvUF9iuzf%2Bcx5Qc5bXrUTUr0j3sX%2FNombKKz6FEHbsTP%2Bq6IqiM%2BFX%2BlwXK5utTRDXeryW5peAwbVNZIEKiX244tXsE8eemjF166S4LZn9tjRyWuN6yRQ8f%2Bt90klD0Sme5PQ1usiwDWjBs1cDlUIR5QbgmncLps7eS%2FzSbHRvi6f1oSTLWmmqoIA7SOxpZxo6JS%2F6DPHwe3oW6QOGxAO64rS88ABeCCRCcE6ToHvdwaUN%2FLZUAFQSK68KYYJLSHYCAQ6vF1d0CeOLGidMWyR7YD%2FrLBBiL15fNqcehlDLvYNY5sLr0TylUX%2F%2FHl5iQflIkUAZ5juC%2FxQWn%2FHqo9DzaiMNqUp4QGOusBvOxx%2FLfiAUG0eYr%2Feb9UZr0MZ%2Bjv10GohdUwP6ibNh8%2BdLwlTTx9Swk7aUnqaVyydakucWlpOyzZ1Gg7HW%2BON%2BYLRf0NI%2Bc8GY3CapPBcnsoo3bSRUdZS1pC7djyhWHTtONK1Qhi%2FIiJcOfm9K9uWmj5cpgOyY7ctJ%2BWFBbEcOKSiBO8zLq8DXjoXNW5XJ5XrTgUxGLmpEobfuO%2BlhTpXYG5S6kM8QBnp4CkYxP7FYZE530mBpTTZi%2FCfWtO4WfaVSR%2F4Y3jmpmmU6u8j89qEcnnihlvvicPA3Yy9x5R0AtUMuA3fRzSul7elg%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20210428T211841Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAYZTTEKKE5IU4AES6%2F20210428%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=4148741fa52fd010438e21db5d42485c860945f524db594003a15c423d7f3d06), 
does not involve Python but will give you a better understanding of 
working with imagery in ArcGIS. Please complete this. The 
second exercise, ["Imagery Across the Platform in ArcGIS Notebooks"](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=23f64f565faa4e78ac24d17e5e8a9ae8) 
is a Python tutorial. Please complete this exercise, including the 
Challenge questions. Please submit your answers to the Challenge 
questions here.
