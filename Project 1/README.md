# Project 1 - Create 2 WebApps from the similar (if not the same) datasets!

## Goal: I want you to create two webapps, one with Leaflet and one with the ArcGIS Javascript API, from the similar datasets
## Assigned: Week 2
## Due: Week 5
## Score: Out of 100 points. Anything exceeding 100 points is a A+!

## The Assignment: 
I would like you to find at least 2 datasets that are somewhat complementary and create a Leaflet app and an ArcGIS Javascript API app for each using essentially the same data.  If you can't use the same data in each app, I'd like the features to be similar in theme. I want you to create the same app twice so you can see the similarities and differences between these JavaScript mapping frameworks. While I want you to use the same or similar data for each map, you may find that using GeoJSON format might be an easier way to use data in Leaflet while a Webmap or Feature Service might be an easier approach using the ArcGIS Javascript API.

## Requirements:
Each application must have:
- At least 2 layers, not including the basemap. You can use difference basemaps in your Leaflet and ArcGIS Javascript API app. **10 points app**
- Use some combination of point, line, and polygon features. I don't just want to see all points! **10 points per app**
- Your layers should each contain at least 10 features. **10 points per app**
- When your code is done, share the apps on Github as live, interactive maps. **10 points per app**
- Include a popup on at least one layer. **10 points per app**
- **Bonus** Add a widget (legend, search, layer list, etc.) or button to one of the apps! **10 points**

## Miscellaneous
1. For this project, I don't want to be the first person you come to with questions. You can talk to your classmate. That being said, I am hoping to see variation in the data and maps that are submitted. **Submit *your* own work**
2. If you are unclear about the instructions, let me know as soon as possible!
3. **I hope to see some beautiful maps!!!**
